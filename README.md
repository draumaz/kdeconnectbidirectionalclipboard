# KDE Connect Bidirectional Clipboard
A Magisk module that allows KDE Connect to automatically sync the system clipboard in both directions.
- [The commands it's running](https://github.com/KDE/kdeconnect-android/commit/edc655da5ac1eb5c3027c8556cc62037a1d4c5ac#diff-ac7ef6bdb0cb04522672bc5149779c69324abb1aadf808b74223a603b5771a6bR31)

# Usage
## Automatic
- When you first open KDE Connect after a reboot, it should prompt you to allow one-time access. Do this, and you will be bidirectional.
## Manual
- If the above workflow didn't work, run the module action within your root manager; it will send you to the same prompt as above.
